            <div className="text-block">
                <p>
                    On January 13th, 2000, I was born in sunny Southern
                    California. I lived there most of my childhood until I was
                    about 8 years old when my family and I moved across the
                    country to New York. I attended Horace Greeley Highschool
                    from 2014-2018 and my senior year got accepted into
                    Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to pursue a degree in
                    Computer Science.

                    I have always had a passion for technology and engineering.

                    graduating from RPI so I can work in the industry.
