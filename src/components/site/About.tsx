                <div className="text-block">
                    <p>
                        On January 13th, 2000, I was born in sunny Southern
                        California. I lived there most of my childhood until I
                        was about 8 years old when my family and I moved across
                        the country to New York. I attended Horace Greeley
                        Highschool from 2014-2018 and my senior year got
                        accepted into Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to pursue
                        a degree in Computer Science.

                    <p>
                        I have always had a passion for technology and
                        engineering, and in middle school was introduced to the
                        world of programming. I am incredibly excited to be
                        graduating from RPI and I look forward to whatever job I
                        end up getting in the industry.
